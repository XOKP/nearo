# ðŸ”¥ A react.js app for local selling, buying, and news

Nearo is a directory or list of personal ads that are presented in proximity order, thus helping to keep the publication relevant. In a way, it could be compared to Craigslist, but with a presentation more in line with the new times and taking certain precautions to maintain users' safety.

Some of the Nearo's features can give you a technological advantage. For example, 360 photos. As you know, 360 images can help a person have a better idea of what they are going to see, with its benefits. Particularly for those posting houses and vehicles.
